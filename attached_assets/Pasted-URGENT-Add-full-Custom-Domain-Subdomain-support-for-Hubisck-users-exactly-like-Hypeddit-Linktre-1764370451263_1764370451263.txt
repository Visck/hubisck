URGENT: Add full Custom Domain / Subdomain support for Hubisck users (exactly like Hypeddit, Linktree Pro, ToneDen).

Requirements (must be 100% functional and beautiful):

1. In the user dashboard, add a new section called “Your Domain” (orange accent, prominent).

2. Two options side-by-side:

   OPTION A — Free Subdomain (default)
   • Input field: “yourname.hubisck.com”
   • Live preview below the field
   • Auto-saves when typing
   • Button “Claim this free link” (orange)

   OPTION B — Your Own Domain (Premium look)
   • Input field: “mymusic.com” or “www.mybrand.com”
   • Status indicator: Not connected / Verifying / Connected (green check)
   • Big orange button: “Connect Your Domain”

3. When user clicks “Connect Your Domain”, show a clean modal with exact instructions (copy-paste ready):

   Title: Connect your own domain in 2 minutes

   Step 1 – Go to your domain provider (Hostinger, GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare…)
   Step 2 – Add this DNS record:

   Type: CNAME
   Name: @    (or leave blank for root domain)
   Value: YOUR_REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_URL.repl.co    ← replace automatically with the real URL of this deployment
   TTL: Auto

   (If the provider doesn’t accept CNAME on root, use this alternative:)
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: YOUR_REPLIT_IP    ← also auto-fill the current public IP

   Step 3 – Click “I’ve added the record”
   → Show “Verifying DNS…” (auto-check every 10 seconds)
   → When resolved → show big green “Connected! Your page is now live at https://yourdomain.com”

4. Server-side logic (Node.js / whatever you use):
   • On every request, read req.headers.host
   • First: look for exact match in users.custom_domain column
   • If found → load that user’s page (ignore path conflicts — slugs can be identical)
   • Else if host ends with .hubisck.com → extract subdomain as username
   • Else → normal routing (hubisck.com main site)

5. Database:
   • Add column to users table: custom_domain VARCHAR(255) NULL
   • Add column: subdomain VARCHAR(100) NULL (for free *.hubisck.com)

6. Cloudflare / DNS tips page (beautiful, copy-paste ready for Hostinger, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap).

7. After connection:
   • Show the custom domain as the main URL everywhere
   • QR code updates automatically
   • Analytics show visits from the custom domain

8. Fallback page if domain not connected or wrong: “This domain is not connected to any Hubisck page yet.”

9. Make everything dark-mode friendly, orange buttons, Hubisck branding.

Do it now, test with a fake domain in preview, and reply exactly: “CUSTOM DOMAIN FEATURE 100% READY AND LIVE”
