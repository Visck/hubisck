You are now building the core "Smart Link Creator" feature for my Linkisck project (a Linktree-style platform with built-in Google Ads remarketing).

Please do the following step by step:

1. Change the project to a full-stack Node.js + Express app (keep the current HTML/CSS/JS files but restructure properly).

2. Create this folder structure:
   - /public (move all current HTML, CSS, JS files here)
   - server.js (main backend file)
   - .env (with secrets)

3. Install these packages:
   express, axios, spotify-web-api-node, dotenv, cors

4. In the "Create Smart Link" page (the page where users create a new link page), completely replace the old "New release / Existing links" section with this new flow:

   - Replace it with a clean input field labeled:
     "Enter any source/track URL to auto-fill your smart link (Spotify recommended)"
   - Big orange button below: "Detect & Auto-Fill →"

5. When the user clicks "Detect & Auto-Fill", do this:
   - Extract the track ID if it's a Spotify link
   - Call Spotify API to get: Title, Artist name, Cover art, and ISRC
   - Use the ISRC to query MusicBrainz API and find official streaming links (YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer, SoundCloud, Tidal, Amazon Music, etc.)
   - Automatically fill the form with:
       • Song title
       • Artist name
       • Cover image (preview)
       • All discovered streaming links (pre-filled in their respective fields)
   - Show a success message: "Magic! We found your song on 7+ platforms"

6. Implement a clean backend endpoint: POST /api/detect-track
   (Use client credentials flow for Spotify – no user login needed)

7. Add proper .env variables:
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

8. Make everything work even if some links are missing (just leave those fields empty for manual entry).

9. Keep the current orange (#FF6600) and white design – make it look professional and smooth.

10. Add loading spinner while detecting and nice success/error messages.

11. Make sure this works perfectly on mobile too.

This is the killer feature that will make musicians love Linkisck. Build it exactly like this – I will test immediately after you finish.
